Version 2.0

Neel had updated the code from the version 1.0.
W5NED had made an upgrade to the phrases trainer and AD0WE had added some txt files from his ninja site.
Neall w5ned is right now writing on a documentation on how it work.

But some of the new feature Neall had added is a 1 letter show and 1 word delete and <ar> for repeat the sound and sent phrases.
He had also change the txt so the program can use both = as end and be without that help a lot with small phrases.
