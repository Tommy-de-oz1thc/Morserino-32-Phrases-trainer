Version 2.0

W5NED had made an upgrade to the phrases trainer and AD0WE had added some txt files from his ninja site.
Neall w5ned is right now writing on a documentation on how it work.

But some of the new feature Neall had added is a 1 letter show and 1 word delete and <ar> for repeat the sound and sent phrases.
He had also change the txt so the program can use both = as end and be without that help a lot with small phrases.
