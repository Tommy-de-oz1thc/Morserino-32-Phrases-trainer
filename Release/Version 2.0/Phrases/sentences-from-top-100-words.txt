So it is.
So be it.
What is it for?
He said no.
What do you see?
Is it like him?
Do you know him?
Then who are you?
The time will come.
Do you know what you look like?
When was that?
Do they know him?
There were two of them.
What would she have said?
Who is she?
What was it?
What is it like?
You have them?
No was there one?
And when will you call?
Come this way.
But it has been so long.
How would you like to have it?
Are you there?
How are you?
You have it.
What is there to see?
How did you know about it?
And all for what?
Will you come and see her?
What will you do, then?
And what did you do then?
Can it be?
You know how it is with her.
There he is, do you see him?
Is it over?
What is he like?
And what did you see?
What is all this?
But it was of no use.
But he had to have it.
You can do it.
But we can go and see.
Then how many are there?
We have no water.
Go on, he said.
The time had come.
Which is it?
They said no more.
Out of the way.
So that was the way.
Do you see him?
Can you do that?
Did you see it?
Did you know them?
But he had no time.
But how about you?
Is that all?
That will do, said he.
Now there is no more to be said.
That is what she did.
That is a long time.
Is he there?
One or two?
Or so they said.
That was all she said.
May we come in?
And how did you find out?
Is she like him?
How do you do?
But will he see it?
What other way is there to look at it?
Do you know what it is?
But what are you up to?
There he is, you see.
What are you up to?
There he is, she said.
Then, how do you know?
Then what is it?
Look at it this way.
Look over it.
What did you do then?
And what do you make of it?
And do you like him?
What do you know of him?
Do as you like.
Is that her?
Who was that?
Did you see her?
And has it come to this?
You can go.
Look at it.
How was that?
What can we do, then?
What was he like?
At what time?
Look at him.
Now what are we to do with you?
Now you know.
But who was she?
What have you come for?
How can it be?
Do as you will.
There you are.
Can one see from there?
But what did you see?
And what is that?
Then you may go.
But what is it?
How is he?
So it was.
Would you do what he did?
Would you like some?
It was from you.
You can have some.
What time is it?
Will that do?
Did you know her?
What is it?
Is it time?
But what will you do?
That will do, he said.
Look at them.
Then what are you up to now?
No one will come, she said.
Do you see it?
You may go.
What could it be?
But what have they been up to?
Had to look the other way.
When is it?
And do you like her?
At what number?
She has it.
Then make it up.
What has she to do with it?
Who can it be?
How did you come by it?
We have him.
Now is your time.
How long has he been there?
How can you know?
Did you know him?
Is that it?
And is that all?
Who will go first?
How is he now?
That was it.
Who was he?
But when will that be?
Who and what are you?
What is it all about?
What was it about?
But what if it is?
What do they call you?
Do you know?
And who is this?
How did he do it?
There you are, he said.
But there was more to it than this.
Who are you?
What did they do?
You know more than we do.
And so on, and so on.
What can this be?
But how is that?
But so it is.
Then there is more to do.
How is she?
And what do you call her?
Has it come to this?
When was it?
What did he do to you?
Call him in.
There they are.
So there it was.
And what was it for?
Who, then, are you?
What are we to do?
What is that?
Do you like him?
And who was that?
What do you make of that?
What is it about?
What do you make of it?
And who are you?
And could she see him?
How did she do it?
There is but one thing to do.
Do you know her?
Are you there?
